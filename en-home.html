        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Fredy is a former leader of a Mexican street gang that operated in southern Mexico. This path ultimately led him to incarceration in the state of Morelos. While serving time he discovered the practice of yoga. Utilising the tools yoga provided, Fredy was able to access the very thing that he had been stripped of… Freedom. Yoga served as a conduit between the mind and body that liberated Fredy and guides him to his new path. Having been released from prison he has dedicated his life to spreading the practice of Yoga throughout mexican prisons leading a group of yogis volunteering with him, in the hopes that inmates, much like himself, can find their own freedom within.</p><br/>
          <p>"I AM FREE" is a documentary that will follow Fredy’s story and show the transformation effects yoga can have on a troubled population as they seek to enhance themselves and reintegrate into society.</p>
